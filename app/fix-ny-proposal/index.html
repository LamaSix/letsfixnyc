			<p>
				In August 2017, Gov. Andrew Cuomo – in response to LIRR commuters’ “Summer of Hell” and the subway
				crisis that sparked outrage among New York straphangers – announced that “congestion pricing is an
				idea whose time has come.” In October, he convened a group of experts and regional leaders to come
				up with a congestion pricing plan, calling for a “real” solution to tackle the “pressing issue of
				heavy congestion on New York City roads and highways, while producing a dedicated funding stream for
				the MTA.”
			</p>
			<p>
				On January 19, 2018, the panel released its proposed plan, which the Move NY coalition has fully
				endorsed. The Fix NYC proposal is a serious and progressive plan that will have a transformative effect
				on the New York metro area – significantly reducing traffic, increasing bus speeds, upgrading our subway
				system and providing improved service and transit access to underserved parts of the boroughs. The Fix
				NYC panel smartly phases in the different elements of the plan so that drivers from so-called “transit
				deserts” have more options for traveling into the Central Business District (CBD) before new zone
				charges go into effect.

			<h2>Benefits</h2>
			<div class="pullquote highlighter orange">
				<p>
					These updated principles will guide the Move NY campaign as the coalition pushes for the enactment
					of the Fix NYC plan, or some close approximation of it. We welcome organizations to review the
					principles and sign on to the campaign.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Under the Fix NYC plan, every New Yorker wins – including those drivers who will face a new charge for
				entering the CBD.</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The Fix NYC plan would raise up to $1.5 billion a year, most of which would be dedicated to
					modernizing our subways, thus significantly reducing crowding and delays.</li>
				<li>A portion of the revenue would be devoted to bringing improved transit access to underserved
					communities in Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island and the Bronx – and doing so before the congestion
					charging zone goes into effect in 2020</li>
				<li>Money would also be available to improve transit services on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley.
					Strategies could include expanding county bus service, adding “last mile” service to connect
					commuters to LIRR and Metro-North, more Express Bus service to the CBD, etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Less Traffic</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>By adding a surcharge on all vehicles traveling into or within the CBD (and/or “taxi zone”), as well
					as enforcing NYC traffic laws (block the box and bus lane enforcement cameras, placard reform),
					vehicle speeds inside the CBD will increase by about 10% initially, and more over time as drivers
					switch to an improved transit system.</li>
				<li>Traffic will also decline in areas outside the CBD (like Astoria, LI City and Downtown Brooklyn) as
					fewer vehicles drive through those areas to reach the CBD; such drivers will see less traffic
					without paying an extra cent.</li>
				<li>Less traffic means fewer missed or late appointments, meetings, classes, shows, deliveries, service
					calls, etc.</li>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Avoided or Limited Tolling</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Drivers coming from Queens and Brooklyn wishing to access FDR Drive can avoid a toll altogether by
					using the Brooklyn Bridge or the upper roadway of the Koch/Queensboro Bridge.</li>
				<li>The congestion charge to drive into the CBD would be capped at once per day, regardless of the
					number of trips made.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Environmental and Health Benefits</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Less traffic means reduced tailpipe emissions, which means fewer asthma incidents among children and
					less climate warming pollution going into the atmosphere.</li>
				<li>Fewer cars on our residential streets means fewer crashes and fewer injuries and fatalities among
					bicyclists and pedestrians. When congestion pricing was implemented in London, total traffic crashes
					fell 40% and the bicycle crash rate fell 80%, saving lives and limbs – and money.</li>

			<h2>Other elements to consider</h2>
			<div class="pullquote highlighter">
				<p>
					Since the Fix NYC plan was released, various interests have advocated for additional components to
					be included in the final plan passed by Albany. They include:
				</p>
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Lock-boxing the revenue.</b><br>It is critically important that revenue raised from any transit
					funding plan is safeguarded so that every dollar raised is spent on improving transit. There are
					many ways to protect the new funding from bonding the annual revenue stream, to including strong
					legal disincentives for redirecting it, to including a “maintenance of effort” provision to ensure
					existing dedicated MTA revenues are preserved.
				</li>
				<li><b>Reforming the MTA.</b><br>The coalition supports companion legislation that would direct the MTA to
					undertake reforms to control the cost of capital projects.
				</li>
				<li><b>Toll relief targeting borough residents.</b><br>This could take the form of lower tolls on the MTA’s seven
					bridges (Triborough, Throg’s Neck, Whitestone, Verrazano, Henry Hudson, Gil Hodges and Cross Bay) or
					crediting drivers who cross two tolled bridges to reach the CBD (so they only pay one toll, not
					two). Note: The Gov. has already embraced some sort of toll relief for the boroughs.

				</li>
				<li><b>Funding for roads and bridges.</b><br>In addition to faster travel and possible toll relief, drivers would
					enjoy better maintained roads and bridges.
				</li>
				<li><b>Fare relief.</b><br>There are a number of options including “Fair Fares,” where low income riders receive
					half-price metro cards, and “CityTicket-7,” where discounts on weekend travel on LIRR and
					Metro-North within city limits are extended to seven days a week.

				</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="pullquote orange-text">
				<p>We support these measures and the benefit they will bring to all New Yorkers who depend on our
					subways, buses, roads and bridges.

			<h2>FAQ's</h2>
			<h5>Isn’t congestion pricing a regressive policy that hurts working class New Yorkers?</h5>
			<p>No, the opposite is true. According to a recent study by the Community Service Society (CSS), the City’s leading
				anti-poverty organization, congestion pricing is actually an extremely progressive policy. On average, only 4%
				of borough residents commute to Manhattan by car. Those car owners are largely wealthy, earning twice as much,
				on average, as New Yorkers who don’t own cars. Likewise, less than 2% of the City’s working poor drive into the
				CBD and would thus face a new congestion fee – that’s roughly 5,000 drivers in a city of 8.5 million people. Put
				another way, for every working poor person who might face a new fee to drive into the CBD, 38 working poor will
				benefit from improvements to the mass transit system, including possible fare discounts. If we’re serious about
				helping poor and middle income New Yorkers, we need to focus on fixing the mass transit system that the
				overwhelming majority of them rely on. </p>
			<h5>Why we should trust the MTA not to waste this new revenue like they do with existing revenue?</h5>
			<p>There’s no question the MTA needs to figure out how to spend our hard earned dollars more effectively and
				efficiently than it does. We strongly endorse making MTA reform part of enacting the Fix NYC plan. But reform
				aside, the transit system has reached a crisis point, and even with cost cutting measures in place, the system
				is in dire straits and needs funding to bring it into the 21st Century. We therefore need a sustainable source
				of new revenue, and the Fix NYC plan is the not only the best and most politically viable plan on the table,
				it’s the only transit revenue proposal that would also tackle our chronic traffic crisis.</p>
			<h5>What about those of us who live in transit deserts and have no choice but to drive?</h5>
			<p>It’s a fair question. That’s why the Fix NYC plan specifically proposes using the revenue raised from the FHV
				surcharges in Year 2 to invest in new transit services in underserved parts of the city before the new
				congestion zone charges go into effect in Year 3. Remember, too, that only 4% of those who live outside the CBD
				travel there by car, and only a portion of those live in transit-poor areas. Put another way, that’s about
				118,000 borough residents who might face a new congestion charge in a city of 8.5 million people, over 80% of
				whom rely on public transit. Nonetheless, the key is to start filling transit gaps so that all New Yorkers have
				good access to reliable transit. </p>
			<h5>New Yorkers can’t afford yet another cost; this city is already too expensive for middle class and poor New
				Yorkers.</h5>
			<p>New Yorkers are already paying a lot more than the cost of the proposed FHV surcharge or congestion fee in the
				hidden costs of chronic traffic ($20 billion a year in lost economic productivity) and a broken transit system
				(~$400 million a year in lost productivity). We’re paying with our time, when we have to leave earlier to avoid
				being late and being docked pay or worse. We’re paying when we’re late getting home from work, to spend time
				with our children and families. We’re paying in missed job or educational opportunities or in lost wages for
				fewer hours worked. </p>
			<h5>Isn’t traffic congestion now worse in London than it was when the city adopted its pricing program in 2003?</h5>
			<p>Studies showed that everywhere congestion pricing has been used – London, Stockholm and Singapore being the best
				known examples – it’s not only significantly reduced traffic and raised revenue to improve transit, but it’s
				been popular with the public once in place. (In London, traffic has grown worse in recent years due to other,
				unrelated factors but a recent analysis demonstrates that traffic would be 20-30% worse if there were no
				congestion pricing system in place.) Every city that has adopted a congestion pricing system has decided to keep
				it. Five years after Stockholm first began tolling drivers in the city center, public support for road pricing
				stood at nearly 70%, and above 50% even among drivers who were most often charged.</p>
